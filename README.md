# CRACKS_SOLVED
My solved cracks. Solutions provided. 
I specify the difficulty of cracks and their quality (in my opinion)

The names of files will be like:
first letter - difficulty, second - quality, then the full name of crack.
`E` - easy, `M` - medium, `H` - hard
`L` - low quality, `M` - medium quality, `H` - high quality
