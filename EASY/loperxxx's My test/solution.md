### Simple login and password checker with some common anti-debugger

---

# First execution

It requires to provide some login and password, then must check it. Since my values are not correct - I got `access denied` message

---

# Dynamic Analysis by using x64dbg

First of all I wanted to check some strings to get some hints

`Right Click -> Search for... -> All User Modules -> String References`

I set breakpoints on the 5-10 strings (other are not useful since they are used for exceptions and errors)

<img width="1709" height="308" alt="Pasted image 20250714142845" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92cf951a-aa8d-4f45-ae06-16898b83bcff" />

After that reloaded app and executed it. Got to the cycle here

## Anti-debugger

Specially `int3` is 

```
A one-byte-instruction used by debuggers to temporarily set a code breakpoint in a running program

Instruction INT3 is an interruption which is used as a software breakpoint.
Without a debugger present, after getting to the INT3 instruction,
the exception EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT (0x80000003) is generated and an exception handler will be called.
If the debugger is present, the control wonâ€™t be given to the exception handler.
```

So app just can check this logic to know if there is debugger (P.s. it does not have any code for checking assembly instructions/exceptions. It is simpler)

---

### Now i want to understand the execution flow

App does some things

<img width="1269" height="615" alt="Pasted image 20250714144211" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b037a46a-c022-433c-8024-52110a781ccd" />


<img width="804" height="56" alt="Pasted image 20250714144455" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a62f7130-39d8-4274-af1a-e33f3890d58a" />

Calls of `argc` and `argv` mean that app manipulates with provided command line arguments (as expected)

---

### I do step-by-step execution until I see anti-debug technique

<img width="1290" height="396" alt="Pasted image 20250714145321" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e30e2c3-8ba8-45bb-8f4a-e49d4f217b32" />

So app uses default WinAPI call `IsDebuggerPresent`

The logic of it is simple, just checks `BeingDebugged` field in `PEB (process environment block)` structure.
So return value of this call must be 1 since we run app under debugger. 

**The aim is to patch this call/register/flow to prevent perfoming anti-debugger**

I set the breakpoint on this call

Of course function sets the register `RAX` (which is used for saving return value here) to `1`, which means Debugger is present

<img width="286" height="28" alt="Pasted image 20250714145842" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82af55cc-ddd8-4099-b11b-68fd62e5ed33" />

I just change it to 0 right on the next line after call is executed

<img width="1016" height="129" alt="Pasted image 20250714150134" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e78b6ac-aeac-43a8-9363-13070ded431e" />

So `DebugBreak` (mechanism of generating exception, often used in debugging) was bypassed

---

So now just `Run` it and will see some main logic

<img width="1705" height="341" alt="Pasted image 20250714150650" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42c5ba9b-860e-4044-a69e-6022da81dae3" />

Run it and entered values

And another `DebugBreak` is here. Maybe like multiple `IsDebuggerPresent` calls
So i just do quickly same things (changing return value of first anti-debugger) and now stand on breakpoints with main logic

There is just another `IsDebuggerPresent` right after the main logic

<img width="1165" height="221" alt="Pasted image 20250714151413" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ab5a846-80bb-453b-8fed-88dfc9092dd1" />

I patched registers again

---

Now it is possible to execute code. Here are another breakpoints. And seems like before this code - app checks if provided arguments are correct



<img width="1577" height="365" alt="Pasted image 20250714154427" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60e584e5-42f3-454a-97e9-76bdda1a43bd" />

Put some breakpoints on `cmp` instructions before this code

Run it, of course `access is denied` and then I reload the app. 

Doing same steps as in previous time to avoid debugger detections

Instead of changing manually return values it is possible just to `hide debugger (PEB)` by using `Debug->Advanced->Hide Debugger (PEB)` after starting debugging (so every time app is reloaded - this step must be perfomed as a first one, since there are no auto-scripts or something else..)

There is `cmp` with `rbx` which on that step equals to `5`. It is likely length checking.


<img width="935" height="58" alt="Pasted image 20250714155628" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11835c7e-045f-4523-b3cc-d49049edf315" />

So since i provided the value of another length - it fails. **Goal is to bypass jne**, cause seems like it is related to access denying. 

I reload the app and set values length of 5 chars (both password and login, but they are not the same)

<img width="247" height="53" alt="Pasted image 20250714155942" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be53ec3a-f633-4e4c-ab06-e8e2cc9d965d" />

and after that this `jne` was bypassed


---

Now `RIP` is here, where `RSI` is 8

So i assume that login must be equaled to the length of 5 and password must be the length of 8



<img width="820" height="18" alt="Pasted image 20250714160041" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/352ef7f8-189b-4753-a8b6-d6db94c093dd" />

Since password was the length of 5 - i got access denied message.

Reloaded app and provided another arguments

<img width="303" height="63" alt="Pasted image 20250714160316" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af3ccfe9-8e62-4671-867f-27cebff72b2b" />


Then i do step-by-step execution in the block where arguments are checked.

At some point register was changed. I assume that it is correct login. Continue execution

<img width="480" height="27" alt="Pasted image 20250714160501" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d9e9596-8711-464e-9727-e9476287a31c" />

Correct(?) login and my login were loaded to memory


<img width="383" height="61" alt="Pasted image 20250714160602" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15ea7ab8-df82-4633-ba47-f8ae1661c537" />



<img width="1195" height="91" alt="Pasted image 20250714160710" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6acc8740-6f38-4077-b9eb-0110f831243f" />

It is comparing the strings

After that i continued the execution and got access denied (look on `jne` on the screen, if strings are not same it jumps and fails)

So reloaded the app and did same things, but instead of `login` i write `admin`

There was no jump on `jne` (because strings equaled to each other)

---

Same check is with password

<img width="514" height="27" alt="Pasted image 20250714161142" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5be96e3b-0fd6-446c-8761-ec49212e2e58" />

Correct password was loaded into memory. Also my string-password was `password`. So i just came across correct password. 

Same logic as with login checking (we load the values, checking equality and if they are equaled we bypass jne jump)

---

It is possible to see that "Access granted" used in registers or in execution flow



# Solution

### `Login: admin`

### `Password: password`
