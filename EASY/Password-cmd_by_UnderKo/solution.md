# Password-cmd_by_UnderKo C/C++ windows x64

First I loaded the .exe file with Ghidra, then started looking for some data like strings, it may help

I found something interesting (highlighted)

Then I moved to this string and found the related function where it is used

The most useful for us here is this part of code

```c
  do {
    FUN_140001010((basic_istream<> *)cin_exref,(longlong *)&local_30);
    _Src = &local_30;
    if (0xf < local_18) {
      _Src = (char ***)local_30;
    }
    sscanf((char *)_Src,"%d",local_38); //gets the input
    if (local_38[0] == 10) {
      pcVar1 = "!crackme!"; //right output
    }
    else {
      pcVar1 = " ohh nooo..."; //input is not correct
    }
    this = FUN_140001270((basic_ostream<> *)cout_exref,pcVar1); 
    std::basic_ostream<>::operator<<(this,FUN_140001640); //outputs the pcVar1
  } while( true );
```

As you can see logic is quite simple: app gets the input and stores that as `local_38` variable. If input is `10` so the `pcVar1` (out output message, like log) will be changed into `!crackme!` and then it will be outputed with last lines of code, which means that solution is correct.

So the solution is `10`
